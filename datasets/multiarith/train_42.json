    "query": " Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums. How many pictures were in each album? ",
    "full_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Nancy put into the two different albums after placing 37 pictures into one album. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the number of pictures left after the first album\nNancy uploaded a total of 41 pictures. She put 37 pictures into one album. To find out how many pictures are left for the other two albums, we subtract the number of pictures in the first album from the total number of pictures.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pictures left} = \\text{Total pictures} - \\text{Pictures in first album}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Pictures left} = 41 - 37\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Pictures left} = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Distribute the remaining pictures into the two albums\nNow that we know there are 4 pictures left, we need to distribute these pictures into the two different albums. The problem does not specify how the pictures are divided between the two albums, so we can denote the number of pictures in the first of the two albums as \\( x \\) and the number of pictures in the second album as \\( y \\).\n\n### Step 3: Set up the equation\nSince the total number of pictures in the two albums must equal the number of pictures left, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\nx + y = 4\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Consider possible distributions\nThere are multiple ways to distribute the 4 pictures between the two albums. Here are a few possible combinations:\n\n1. \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 4 \\) (All pictures in the second album)\n2. \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 3 \\) (One picture in the first album and three in the second)\n3. \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 2 \\) (Two pictures in each album)\n4. \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\) (Three pictures in the first album and one in the second)\n5. \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\) (All pictures in the first album)\n\n### Conclusion\nWithout additional information on how Nancy chose to distribute the pictures, we can conclude that there are several valid distributions of the 4 pictures between the two albums.

To find out how many pictures go into each of these albums, we divide the remaining pictures by the number of albums.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pictures per album} = \\frac{\\text{Remaining pictures}}{\\text{Number of albums}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Pictures per album} = \\frac{40}{8} = 5\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nEach of the 8 albums will contain 5 pictures.\n\n### Summary\n- Pictures in the first album: 11\n- Pictures in each of the 8 albums: 5\n\nThus, the final answer is that Nancy put 5 pictures in each of the 8 different albums.",
    "answer": "5",
    "condensed_reasoning": "Nancy uploaded 51 pictures: 11 in one album, 5 in each of 8 others."

To find out how many students will be in each group, we divide the number of picked students by the number of groups:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in each group} = \\frac{\\text{Number of students picked}}{\\text{Number of groups}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in each group} = \\frac{48}{8}\n\\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of students in each group} = 6\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the number of students in each group is \\( \\boxed{6} \\).",
